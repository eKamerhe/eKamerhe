- 👋 Hi, I’m @eKamerhe

- 👀 I’m interested in visual arts🎨
        I speak fluent Adobe and can turn a blank canvas into a masterpiece faster than you can say "Ctrl+Z."
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning BSc IT
        (which I’m pretty sure stands for "Brewing Strong Coffee in IT") ☕
  
- 💞️ Looking to team up on small projects (think "fun-sized" chaos, not "dumpster fire" scale).
  
- 📫 How to reach me esther1kamerhe@gmail.com
        DMs open, carrier pigeons tolerated, smoke signals…eh, let’s stick to email.
  
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
        (also accepts "wizard," "code whisperer," or "human who definitely sleeps enough")
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can debug code in my sleep…literally. My keyboard has permanent indentations from my face. 💻😴
